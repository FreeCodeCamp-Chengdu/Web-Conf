    nodejs_cpp_usage_topic:
        "This topic revolves around when, why, and how to use C++ in Node.js to unlock more possibilities (such as improving performance, reducing development costs, and doing some amazing things): <br> 1.For scenarios with heavy computation and simple input/output data, using C++ extensions instead of the original Pure JavaScript approach will yield unexpected results.<br> 2.For scenarios that already have mature C++ libraries, reinventing the wheel for Node.js is undoubtedly a high-cost development approach.<br> 3.There are some low-level aspects that Node.js cannot reach, which can be exposed through C++ extensions and then encapsulated in Node.js.<br> 4.Sometimes, we don't need to create something like Electron that combines Node.js, but we can use Node.js's C++ extensions to wrap an existing game engine, bridging the threads they each manage independently.<br> Audience Takeaways<br> 1.Understand some internal mechanisms of Node.js.<br> 2.Gain a preliminary concept of interaction between Node.js and C++.<br> 3.Apply this in their toy projects and even use this approach in production environments.",

    history_of_agile_in_china_detail:
        "In 2002, the introduction of Extreme Programming in the magazine Programmer and the publication of the Extreme Programming series by People's Posts and Telecommunications Publishing House marked the entry of Agile into China. It has been sixteen years since Agile entered China.\n\nSixteen years ago, there were very few people in the whole country who believed in Agile; sixteen years later, the CIO of a major bank mentioned Agile as one of the key words in his speech at the conference. The changes are vast and impressive.\n\nToday, Agile has become the most widely adopted software development method, reflecting the rising status of IT in the national economic life, the rise of technicians from outsourcing coders to the core competitiveness of enterprises, and the rise of China's economy in the global economy.\n\nOver these sixteen years, how has Agile been introduced, promoted, disseminated, ignored, resisted, accepted,praised highly, transformed, and faded away, evolving from a trickle into a tidal wave of the times? How has the source of change been inherited? Who, at what key time points, played important roles in promoting it?\n\nAs a witness and participant in the sixteen-year development of Agile in China, I hope to look back and sort out this history, carving a monument for this history and the people involved.",
