    angular_description:
        'As a comprehensive development platform, the Angular team provides a complete development environment: various functional libraries, command-line tools, IDE integration, mobile support, and more. However, the completeness of native support has also created a narrow comfort zone for some Angular developers, causing some to give up exploration, treating official support as the entirety of Angular, and themselves falling into the routine of debugging Components and Services day after day. In fact, there is a vast world beyond the official comfort zone of Angular. For example, we can build complete applications smaller than jQuery using tools other than Webpack, dynamically load any remote components without the need for unified packaging, and achieve runtime dynamic view concatenation under AOT compilation... This sharing will bring endless possibilities beyond the comfort zone.',
